# React Native boilerplate

## Description

This is the boilerplate for an application with lots of pages and forms, which is based on `with-typescript` React Native app template. These technologies are used in addition:

- [formik](https://formik.org) and [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for form logic
- [react-native-router-flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) for routing
- [react-native-i18n](https://github.com/AlexanderZaytsev/react-native-i18n) for localization
- [tailwind-rn](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/tailwind-rn) for Tailwind-like styling
